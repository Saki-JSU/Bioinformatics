# Biological analysis of single cell RNA-seq data
This is a reproduction for [Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/basic-quality-control-qc-and-exploration-of-scrna-seq-datasets.html). The raw data refers to [Deng et al. 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1245316). The tutorial author made some preprocess for the raw data and upload it in [here](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/data/?prefix=data/deng/). The number of genes do not match with that in GSE77288. Here we use the preprocessed data directly.
